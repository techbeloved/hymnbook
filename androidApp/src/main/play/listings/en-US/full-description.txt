One of the major ways Christians have let the Word of God dwell in us richly throughout history has been through singing hymns in church gatherings. Hymns are beloved because they share the richness of the gospel and the beauty of Jesus Christ in a catchy and memorable way. Hymns and other truth-filled songs have the habit of ministering to our hearts, giving us hope and faith. They teach us theology, help us minister to each other, unite us with Christians from the past centuries, and take our eyes off ourselves and put them on Jesus. You can now have a complete hymnbook in your palms wherever you go: traveling, in the office, at work, at gym, don't miss any moment of worship through hymns. 
The Watchman Hymnbook is a collection of 300 selected Hymns and Songs for Christian Fellowship as found in the Hymnal of The Watchman Catholic Charismatic Renewal Movement (WCCRM). The Watchman Hymnbook app contains above 250 midi tunes which will help anyone sing along easily.
